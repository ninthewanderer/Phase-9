# Phase-9

This project was worked on over the course of the entire semester, every assignment providing us with an opportunity to apply our newfound knowledge. The goal was to iterate on this project as we learned new concepts, allowing us to expand our understanding of C and computer science as a whole. The game is based off of the classic card game Phase 10, although in our version we reduced it to 9 phases since we did not implement a color system--hence the name Phase 9.

Throughout my time working on the project, I learned and implemented the following:
- Compiling and running a C file using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
- Defining and using macros/constants for code management and simplification
- Usage of loops and randomization to create a "deck of cards" array
- Implementation of the Durstenfeld shuffle algorithm for deck-shuffling
- Turn-based system implementation with decision-making
- Parsing through and printing data from a text file to display a leaderboard
- Usage and creation of header files in C to keep code organized and concise
- Utilizing pointers and dynamic memory allocation for streamlined and mindful memory management
- Usage of structure data type to organize player information

Phase 9 was an invaluable experience because it gave me the opportunity to translate the concepts I learned into a playable example. By turning the fun act of making a game into a learning experience, I was able to solidify my understanding of fundamental C topics. I look forward to learning about the more complex capabilities of C, as it is a robust and powerful language with seemingly infinite possibilities for its usage.
